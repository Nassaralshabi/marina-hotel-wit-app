## üîí Technical Implementation Details

### Database Architecture (Room)
```kotlin
// Key entities with relationships
9 Room entities: Guest, Room, Booking, Payment, BookingNote, 
                Employee, SalaryWithdrawal, User, Supplier

Proper foreign key constraints with CASCADE and RESTRICT
Type converters for Date/Long storage
Flow-based queries for reactive UI updates
Transaction management for data integrity
```

### Repository Pattern
```kotlin
HotelRepository handles all business operations:
- createBooking() with guest validation and room status updates
- checkOut() with payment verification
- Transaction-safe operations with database consistency
- Flow streams for real-time data updates
```

### ViewModel Architecture
```kotlin
9 specialized ViewModels for clean separation:
- LoginViewModel: Authentication and user management
- DashboardViewModel: Room status and occupancy analytics
- BookingViewModel: Booking operations and guest management
- PaymentViewModel: Payment processing and financial calculations
- ReportsViewModel: Analytics and reporting functionality
- Additional ViewModels for specialized features
```

### UI Implementation
```kotlin
RecyclerView adapters for efficient data display
Fragment-based navigation with proper lifecycle management
Material Design 3 components throughout
Custom drawable resources for consistent styling
Proper accessibility and internationalization
```
